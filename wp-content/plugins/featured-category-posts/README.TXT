Use Featured Category Posts Widget to show from specific categories with per widget thumbnail size and position options, per widget excerpt length control, toggle options for author, post date, title, excerpt and more

== Description ==

Drag a widget to the location of choice, select a category specify how many posts to show, choose a thumbnail size specific for this placement instead of the same thumbnail size for every use of the widget, set a thumbnail position (top of content, left of content, right of content), decide whether to show post title, decide whether to show post excerpt and how long the excerpt should be. You can set a different excerpt length for each use of the widget. Or exclude an excerpt and show only title. Or exclude both title and excerpt and show only thumbnail. Show or hide author and date. Show additional post titles in a list underneath your main features. Style each widget differently by supplying individual before and after widget code and before and after title code or leave those sections blank to default to your current theme widget styles. You can really do a lot with it. There are other category posts widget plugins out there that are quite popular and have a great reputation. This one isn’t trying to take anything away from those plugins or the developers. It’s just a new addition that has some extra features those lack while probably lacking some features they have. Try it and see if it works for you.
