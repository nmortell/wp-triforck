Supports AdSense®, Javascript, XHTML and PHP code. This widget makes it possible for you to display 125x125 ad squares ( or some other configurable size ad, advertisement, banner ) into a widget-ready bar for WordPress®. PHP code can be disabled for security when its installed on a Multisite Blog Farm.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `/ad-squares-widget` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress®.
3. Navigate to `Appearance->Widgets` and add the widget.

***Special instructions for Multisite Blog Farms:** If you're installing this plugin on WordPress® with Multisite/Networking enabled, and you run a Blog Farm ( i.e. you give away free blogs to the public ); please `define("MULTISITE_FARM", true);` in your /wp-config.php file. When this plugin is running on a Multisite Blog Farm, it will mutate itself ( including its menus ) for safe compatiblity with Blog Farms. You don't need to do this unless you run a Blog Farm. If you're running the standard version of WordPress®, or you run WordPress® Multisite to host your own sites, you can ( and should ) skip this step.*

== Description ==

This widget makes it possible for you to display 125x125 ad squares ( or some other configurable size ) into a widget-ready bar for WordPress®. You can have just 2 squares, or as many as 8 running together. It also supports multi-widget options. So technically you could have even more than 8 if you add it to a bar more than once. Each ad square accepts any HTML/JavaScript code, so it will work with standard affiliate ads, or even with ad network codes. You can also configure the widget to shuffle the positioning of your squares if you like.

The Ad Squares widget supports embedded PHP code too. If you know a little PHP scripting, you could add conditionals to the code that you place into this widget. For example, if you wanted to show different ads based on the category that is currently being displayed on your blog, you could do something like this:<!--more-->

	<?php if(is_category("green-lizards")): ?>

	  insert green lizard ad campaign here

	<?php elseif(is_category("purple-socks")): ?>

	  insert purple socks ad here

	<?php else: ?>

	  insert default ad code here

	<?php endif; ?>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the best size ( width x height ) to use? =
The recommended size is 125x125, but it does not have to be that exact size. Just be sure to stick with the same size in each square so things remain symmetrical.

= What type of code can I put into the ad squares? =
Feel free to paste any type of ad code into the squares. AdSense®, XHTML, PHP, IFrame, JavaScript, whatever.
