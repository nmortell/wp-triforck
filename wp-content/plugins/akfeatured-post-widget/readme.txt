== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Once I install and activate the plugin, How do I use it? =

This is only a widget, so you will need to drag and drop the widget into a sidebar or other widgetized area of your blog before you can configure it to work. 

= I dragged the widget over, but I can't set custom post types or image size, what do I do? = 

You will need to "save" the plugin so that you can fully configure the widget. Wordpress is weird sometimes.

= How did you make such an awesome plugin? =
