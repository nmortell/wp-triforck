== Description ==

Manage your own site and mobile ads from a simple WordPress admin panel.  
Use our shortocde or widgets to place graphic banner, button, or tower ads anywhere on your site.
You own and manage the ad space and ads on your site.

This the initial release and we are looking for feedback.   
If you don't see a feature, ask us and you might see it in the next release.
We publish updates to our WordPress plugins on a monthly schedule, so you may want to bookmark this page and check back for more features next month!

= Features =

* List, sort, and search for ads by title or tag.

* Uses built-in WordPress media manager to manage graphics.
* Shortcodes with options make it easy to customize.

** Set and save default ad settings.

= Support =

Support for the plugin can be found in the [WordPress Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/adpress).  If you have an urgent issue or want one-on-one support you can [purchase premium support](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/product-support).

You can also view the [CSA Product Documentation](http://www.charlestonsw.com/support/documentation) for more information about the plugin.

= Special Requests =

I accept feature requests for all plugins. The most requested features will make it into the next version if time permits.

If you need something NOW, or are looking for something beyond a basic "tweak" of the plugin, please check out the
[Customization Service](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/customization/).

= Upgrades and Patches =

I try to release at least one upgrade/patch every couple of months.   I have multiple plugins and limited time and focus on the plugins that get the most feedback and input from users.

The main product will always remain fully functional and free.
If you'd like to have some of the latest "bells & whistles" purchasing a premium add-on is a great way to help support me and encourage even more items get added the next time around.


= My Philosophy =

I strive to create code that runs efficiently and without bugs.
In my opinion, well-written plugins are few and far between.
While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, far too many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have too many hidden problems.
I have found that over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when you turn off the "hide all the problems" settings.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance via the typical default logging settings.
While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked.
The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During 20+ years of software development, I have found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road.
Warnings today often become errors tomorrow.
Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near all those warning messages.
Some warnings are telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow".
Eventually tomorrow will come.

While my plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, I do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be.
My code is not perfect, but when I find a bug I try to fix it fast.
If I create a bug I try to fix it even faster.
To sum it all up, I like to write plugins that last.
I hope you appreciate my work.

= Rate This Plugin =

Please [rate this plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adpress/)!
Rating the plugin, hopefully with 5 stars, helps increase the exposure on WordPress, which generates more downloads and purchases of add-ons.
The more add-ons I sell the easier it is to put food on the table and give me more time to code cool new features.
No ratings, no food, more hours working as the Walmart Greeter, less coolness in the plugins.

Give me a chance to address your concerns if this plugin doesn't earn 5 stars by [contacting me](http://www.charlestonsw.com/mindset/contact-us/) directly or by posting in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/adpress) here at WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is included in the plugin? =

A simple ad manager that connects images to links via a custom post type.
You can then reference these ads by ID or slug in shortcodes and widgets.
The base plugin is free and fully functional.

= How do I report a bug? =

Post in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/adpress).
You can also [contact me](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/product-support) to request premium support if you need immediate assistance.

= What are the premium add-ons? =

In response to feature requests from customers, I created a series of premium add-on packages for my plugins.
These features extend the functionality of the plugin beyond the basic service and features and can be purchased ala-carte.
This gives those customers who want more out of the plugin the extra features they desire while keeping the main plugin as
efficient as possible for everyone else.   It also provides a great way to support future development while getting a
"little something extra" when contributing to my efforts.

Current premium add-ons:

* [Pro Pack](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/adpress-pro-pack) : More settings including ad defaults.

= Who is Charleston Software Associates? =

Currently it is one guy hacking code in a home office.

= What are the terms of the license? =

The license is GPL.  You get the code, feel free to modify it as you
wish. I prefer that customers pay because they like what I do and

on the [CSL License Terms page](http://www.charlestonsw.com/products/general-eula/) or (this blog post about licensing)[http://www.charlestonsw.com/license-and-refund-policy/].

= How can I translate the plugin into my language? =

* Find on internet the free program POEDIT, and learn how it works.
* Use the .pot file located in the languages directory of this plugin to create or update the .po files.

* For more information on POT files, domains, gettext and i18n have a look at the I18n for WordPress developers Codex page and more specifically at the section about themes and plugins.
