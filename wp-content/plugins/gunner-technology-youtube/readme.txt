== Description ==

The Gunner Technology YouTube plugin adds a highly configurable YouTube widget, which can display videos by uploader (playlists, favorites or most recent) or playlist.

You can control the size of the video and thumbnails as well as how many videos are displayed and how they open (inline or in a lightbox).

This plugin makes use of the JSON-P API, so there is no strain on your WordPress site. It's completely asynchronous for maximum performance.

You can see the plugin in action on virtually all our [client sites](http://codyaswann.com) and [our own](http://gunnertech.com).
