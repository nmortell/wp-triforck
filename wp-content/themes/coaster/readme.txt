NOTES

1. Logo and navigation areas are intended to line up in one row. In case Blog name is very long and/or top level navigation includes many items, navigation will wrap underneath the logo, which results in poor look. Consider shortening your Blog name, or creating drop down navigation to limit number of items in the top level navigation.
